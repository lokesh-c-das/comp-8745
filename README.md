# COMP-8745
Project: Recommendation System for Movie Ratings

# Team: 
- Lokesh Chandra Das (UID: U00740183)
- Navid Mohammad Imran (UID: 00761100)

# Implemented algorithm: 
Item-Item collaborative filtering using cosine similarity

# Steps of implementation:
- Load dataset
- Create user-item matrix
- Calculate item-item similarity
- Predict rating

# Instructions for running code:
- Import necessary libraries (if any library missing in the system)
- Since the submission is a jupyter notebook, we rcommend using Anaconda Navigator (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) to run code
- After opening Anaconda Navigator, navigate to the location of the jupyter notebook file (.ipynb)
- We recommend to use "Run all" from cell menu in the jupyter notebook. Otherwise, run all modules step by step from the beginning.
- Use the exact movieID and userID that is included in the original dataset as we are mapping it to zero based index to make the calculations simple. For example, 
**predict_rating(28,7)** where userID = 28 and movieID = 7
